                    How I Got Into <b>Web Development</b>

                  <p>
                    At university as a first yearn we were taught C++ but most
                    of the time even though it felt like were programming, I
                    didn't see the point of the programs we were building
                    especially how they would apply in the real world so I
                    wanted to build something cool and useful Apps were not
                    popular that time and the browser was the common way to find
                    information so I came across a book in the library about web
                    development. I took the book home, sat at the edge of my
                    bed. And within 30 minutes, I was learning HTML, and for the
                    first time even though HTML is just a "Markup language", I
                    was excited because the was progress. <br /><br />
                    how I began with the WAMP stack in 2014 and have a handful
                    of failed startups that no one has ever used but I've learnt
                    a lot from that. Most were built on PHP since it was hyped a
                    a lot because Facebook was using it. I one day stumbled upon
                    an article that highlighted why PHP should be avoided, that
                    really brought me to tears but I was in denial I used its
                    frameworks such as lavarel and code Igniter but found the
                    latter to be fun I should say. But still, the fact that
                    their skeletons were PHP, my mind kept looping to that
                    article. I finally swallowed my pride and migrated to
                    Python. Oh was beautiful, simple and effortless. I could
                    even find apps on the Play store and run it on my phone. I
                    tried frameworks like Djanjo and Flask but because I was
                    building simple websites, I opted for Flask. <br /><br />
                    I realised that most of my websites, the UI/UX was rubbish
                    because I was more of a backend guy and having to sit on the
                    monitor picking colors and fonts was not worth my time, so
                    that's how I discovered bootstrap v3, and it was great
                    because it was even created and used by twitter. For user
                    interactivity I had to learn JavaScript but that took me
                    time, but the second I came to terms with it, I saw how
                    impactful it had on my work and the term "SPA" and "MEAN
                    stack" were being thrown around much in the term world so I
                    tried Angular Js but never really held on, I sticked to
                    backend again. As years went by, I realised how difficult
                    and ineffeciet it was for the frontend and the backend to
                    communicate. I had to use JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, MYSQL,
                    PHP/FLASK/DJANGO just to respond to the client's request. So
                    I browsed for a solution online and the "MEAN stack" came up
                    again but as I was about to jump ship, a mega yatch swooped
                    in in titled the "MERN stack" and I've been happy ever
                    since. And the funny thing is that React Js was built by
                    Facebook.
